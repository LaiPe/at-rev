- When talking about the new world of work and the way things are changing, let's get down to the nuts and bolts of what actually is under discussion.

Now part of this is around where people are, but also about the way in which people are working.

Whether that's full-time, part-time, contingent work, or gig economy, where, how much people are working, lots of different factors just to name a few.

What's important to recognize here though is that these have huge effects.

They have effects at two different levels.

On the one hand, they affect organizations.

So if you think about what you need to do as an organization, you need things like strategic planning.

You need to know where you're gonna go and how you're gonna get there.

You have physical constraints like your real estate decisions.

How many offices, how big are they?

How much head count can you actually support?

Hiring and head count itself.

Succession plans, who is going to take over when the current leadership changes, transitions, or leaves?

Control systems, all of these are factors that organizations need to manage well, but actually come in and are a real challenge when you now have to deal with people working in this new model, these new models having to do with these different types of changes.

But it's not just that.

It's not just the organizational level effects.

It's also the employee experience and we already are seeing very strong effects.

This has impacts, the way in which you work has impacts on things like how engaged you feel, how loyal you feel to the organization, the relationships and the networks that you form and you build, your ability to grow and develop within your organization and within your role.

It affects things like norms, culture, collective goods like that, and even as deep as the purpose and the meaning of the work that you're doing.

The important thing is these are all affected by these decisions, so it's not a trivial set of tick boxes that we need to check off.

I would also argue that the biggest debate that is currently going on is who actually gets to decide.

There's a very big tension going on between whether this is owned by the leaders of organizations or actually owned by the employees themselves.

This is a very real tension and the simple answer is it's both.

Neither side owns the entire debate.

Neither side gets to make the entire decision, but we have to think about how we pull those pieces together.

So when trying to design the way in which we're working in an organization, we need to think about what are the decisions we need to make?

And what makes this difficult is in my experience, and this is my experience both teaching, doing research, and also as a consultant working with a lot of organizations, what makes this difficult is it's not actually one decision.

This is actually the result of attention of at least three different dimensions, something very difficult to find on a picture.

So I was very happy when I found this one.

What do I mean by this?

Well, first and foremost, the starting point, we need to design our work in a way that delivers on our obligations.

Companies have a value proposition.

There's something they are giving to their stakeholders, to their shareholders.

We need to make sure that we're designing our work in the best way possible.

Maybe I think that the best way for me to deliver is to create real collaborative work and that requires people being physically co-located.

On the other side, maybe I think that actually the most important thing is innovation and innovation is driven by people with different opinions, so it's really good to be spread far and wide.

There isn't a right answer.

This is about understanding what it is you're trying to deliver, but the goal here is effectiveness.

But this isn't the only thing in play.

One of the things that has come up very, very strongly, particularly amidst the war for talent, is the demands of the labor market.

If you ask anybody who is involved in recruiting what is the number one question, what is the first question that you get from somebody applying for a job today?

I can almost guarantee you that their answer will be what's your remote offering?

Can I work from home?

Can I work remote?

Can I work from anywhere?

Can I be a digital nomad?

The point being this is now a critical decision that you need to factor in or a critical factor you need to bring into your decisions around being able to attract and retain the best talent.

If they are requiring a way of working that you aren't offering, you're not gonna get them.

So you recognize that these may be intention.

The best way to design your work to deliver may not be the best way to design your work to attract and retain talent, and it's not just two.

There's a third bucket.

The third bucket is around the social fabric of the organization.

Things like having a strong and cohesive culture.

Something that I, particularly as an organizational behavior scholar, but as somebody who works with a lot of companies has seen is a critical component.

Things like social networks and relationships, feelings of trust and support.

All of these are factors that are again, shaped by the way in which we work and importantly may not be the same optimal design for all of these.

There may be one design that's better for effectiveness but sacrifices staffing.

There may be another that's really good for the social fabric, but not the best for effectiveness.

The point being is there is this tension and that's a very difficult thing for us to resolve and in many organizations, it's being spoken over, not spoken to.

We see people having this conversation because what's interesting to recognize is this is driven by almost a fundamental ideological belief about where value comes from in an organization.

On the one hand, I guarantee you, as a little thought experiment, you can think of somebody in your organization who would say look, at the end of the day, all this soft stuff doesn't matter.

You deliver or you don't and if you deliver, that's all that we care about.

Think about that person in your head.

Now can you also think about somebody, and again this person could be you, I should be clear, can you also think about somebody else who would say look, give me the right team.

I can solve any problem.

It could be a staffing issue.

It could be a technical issue.

it could be a sales issue.

As long as I have the right people, I'm good.

You can think about that person and I bet you can also think of somebody in your organization who would say look, people come and go.

Projects come and go.

All these things change, but there's something special, something in the air, the secret sauce that makes us unique and is our advantage.

If you can think of those three people and those three people aren't the same person, you see exactly why this is a challenge because those people are trying to optimize, design an optimal solution, on three different dimensions at the same time.

This is what I speak about in this article here.

The goal here is to think about and recognize this isn't a simple choice.

It's about managing attention.
